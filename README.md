Your Drink Driver

Welcome to the DD app! Have you ever been at home and had a drink or two, only to find out, you ran out of all of your beer, your wine or your liquor!! Have no fear! Your drink driver is here! This app will deliver beer, wine and liquor to your door all within an hour! Never run our of liquid courage again! 

Did you know that 52% of all car crashes occur 5 miles or less from home? That percentage increases to 77% within 15 miles of your home!
On average every 90 seconds, a person is injured in a drunk driving accident and the average number of people driving drunk per day is almost 300,000. Only 4,000 of those people are arrested. In 2013, one person was killed every 53 minutes due to alcohol related accidents. 

My hope with DD is to allow everyone, everywhere the ability to make the right choice and get your libations safely, yet affordably. Together, with the logistical knowhow of my husband, we created this app, to help put a stop to drunk driving in the greater Atlanta area. 

So, if you need some wine, drop us a line, if you need some beer, we are here, if you need some liquor, we will deliver it quicker and if you are just lazy and don't want to go to the store, we will show up at your door! 

Technical Specifications:

To build out this application, I used MEN stack, which is Mongoose, Express and NodeJs, using MongoDB for the database and using a built in helper methods using Handlebars, to help build out semantic templates, frustration free. HTML, CSS and JavaScript were used for style and functionality. This application was deployed using Heroku.  This is a full crud application, that has the following:
